<h3 align="center">Full stack developer, researcher and former journalist from Brazil</h3>

- <strong> Who am I? </strong> </br> I like to be at the intersection of communication, research and technology. I love pink, I watched all the Cinderella movies and I'm crazy about Sofia Coppola's cinema and Sophie Kinsella's literature. But it was by coding that I found myself back at the primordial point.

- <strong> Facts about me </strong> </br> I was one of the first openly autistic Brazilian youtubers to address the issue. Today I have 70,000 subscribers to Mundo Autista, the oldest Brazilian YouTube channel featuring autistic people. Also, I am the author of ten books, from novels to academic research.

- <strong> Bachelor's degree </strong> </br> I have a master's degree in Communication, Territorialities and Vulnerabilities from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. In addition, I am a developer for Labenu.

- <strong> Work </strong> </br> I have been a developer at Raia Drogasil RD since March 2022. I was a fellow of the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais between 2020 and 2022. I am a member of Afetos, a research group on Communication, Accessibility and Vulenrabilities and also of TransTech SocialEnterprises. I study and practice react.js, node,js, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and SQL.

- <strong> Awards </strong> </br> In 2016, I became the youngest person to receive the Grand Necklace of Municipal Legislative Merit in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In 2019, I was awarded the Special Tribute award from the European Union's Erasmus+ program.

- <strong> Themes </strong> </br> My works revolve around autism and neurodiversity, affective and loving accessibility, gender issues, virtual ethnography, technology, communication through digital media and life narratives.
